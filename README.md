# Doggo Gallery — Dog Image Generator

Single page website that lets users search for dog images by breed using the free Dog CEO API. 

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser/live server
2. Type a breed (full or partial), e.g., `bulldog`, `retr`, `shep`, or `shiba`.
3. Click the serach button.
4. The page fetches random images for each matching breed and displays them in a grid.

> The API is free and needs no key

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (custom flex grid, responsive via media query)
- JavaScript (`fetch` + DOM APIs)
- Google Fonts (Onest)


## Ideas for Future Improvement
1. Add a loading spinner
2. Add a dropdown with auto-complete suggestions
3. Add a "favorites" feature to save images

## User Stories
1. As a visitor, I want to type a full or partial dog breed and press Search, so I can quickly see matching dog images.
2. As a visitor, I want the results displayed in a readable, responsive grid, so I can scan multiple images without scrolling forever.
3. As a mobile user on a very small screen (≤320px), I want the layout to stack cleanly, so the site remains usable.
